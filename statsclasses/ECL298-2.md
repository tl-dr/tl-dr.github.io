**Official Description**: R is powerful, flexible, open-source software for manipulating and analyzing data. It is constantly being improved and expanded by a diverse group of people. Many researchers claim that data analysis with R is the way of the future because of its accessibility (it is free), versatility (advanced tools for almost any field, from finance to GIS and genomics), flexibility (the question is not if you can do it, but how), and reproducibility of analysis (through short scripts). This course will help you to become comfortable with basic data manipulation in R, beginning with installing and setting up the program, learning the basic idiom, and continuing on to manipulating and organizing your data, creating good graphics, and learning how to find more help.
