**Other info and comments**: This is the master's level Ag Econ econometrics class - this is a more accessible version of the ECN 240 series (the PhD sequence), and has less theory and more application. Its focuses on regression (cross sectional and time series), and its more applicable to analysis of observational (rather than experimental) data.

The course is now taught as two courses, 256A and 256B, in the fall and winter.
