Pretty raw notes this week from a discussion about how food webs respond
to nutrient starvation and excess.

### Whalen on consumption in Food Webs

-   Boersma and Elser (2006) - fitness cost of excessive P. Implications
    for models - but what about competition as a more likely limiting
    factor?
-   Not sure about the "food left on the table" argument.
-   What about the metabolic costs? Not mentioned in the paper.
-   Nonlinearity in P-growth relationship could be coexistence mechanism
-   Raubenheimer and Simpson (2004) - Fitness and body composition can
    be affected by food quality. Can't maintain homeostasis. With
    locusts, fitness maximized at protein/carbohydrate balance, but body
    composition changes
-   Plath and Boersma (2001): Genralists may change intake behaviorally
    in response to P enrichment
    -   Dynamic energy models of Daphinia S. Kooijman.

-   Raubenheimer and Simpson (2004) - organisms reach different
    compositions on monoculture diets, but diverse on polyculture diets
    (They promote geometric framework)
-   What are the evolutionary adaptations to food quality (gut
    architecture, consumption physiology, out-of-body digestion, feeding
    at multiple trophic levels/guilds (Some evidence of N-limited
    predators), seasonal issues). Cannibalism is optimal, but other
    costs? (Disease, etc.)
-   Apple et al. (2009) - High density of plants leads to low-P plants,
    making food quality low and reduction in predator abundance. Note
    that the plant (lupines) are N-fixers. However, there are other
    potential explanations (predation + plant cover)
-   Hawlena and Schmitz (2010): Predation causes more energy use in
    grasshoppers, increasing C consumption and then reducing fecal
    elemental composition. Higher C:N. Then changes the composition of
    plants, which are fertilized by grasshoppers.
-   What's the correct scale? For higher trophic levels, is it more
    about macromolecules? Ecosystem v. 2-species interaction.

-   Moore et al. (2001) Diatoms are iron and silicate limited. Different
    organisms limited in different areas. But this model doesn't
    incorporate light limitation, nor secondary limitation. Moore et al.
    (2009)
-   1.  Found high P content in autotrophic communities, low in
        heterotrophs

-   Most cyanobacteria are N fixers, but not those in Bertilsson et al.
    (2003)
-   Berman-Frank and Cullen (2001) - N fixation is iron lmited, results
    in loss of photosynthetic
-   Kustka and Sanudo-Wilhelmy (2003) - Swotch between Fe and P
    limitation at distinct N:P ratio
-   White et al. (2006) - differences between lab and field. Organisms
    are flexible, but co-limitation limits extreme variation
-   How to reconcile Frigstad and Andersen (2011) with Bertilsson et al.
    (2003)? Filtration artifact?
-   Gruber et al. (2009) Ciliates prefer *older* *E.Coli* with higher
    levels of carbon.

### Notes on Boersma and Elser (2006)

**Central idea: There's a cost to consuming foods with excess nutrients
and needing to excrete the extra.**

(Given that human babies can die from excess nitrate in the water, I
must agree)

Many lakes are P-limited, but it has been assumed that variation in P:C
ratios above levels that limit growth - the threshold element ratio
(TER) - is irrelevant to animal performance

Many of these studies come from aquaculture. Several taxa (Fig. 1) have
a peak of growth at some fraction of dietary P. Ecological studies are
rarer, typically using only 2 levels of treatment.

#### Possible mechanisms:

-   In plants, excess P "might have changed other variables in the
    plants, such as carbohydrate availability". What?
-   Since P enrichment is rare, organisms don't adjust well to being
    carbon limited, reducing growth.
-   Experimental limitations, but also organisms that store P, have
    prevented this observation in ecological systems

#### Context

-   Basal consumers in food webs are generally nutrient-deprived and
    more more likely not to have mechanisms to deal with excess
    nutrients. Similarly slow-growing and other low P-content organisms.
-   There can be considerable heterogeneity in nutrient content, leading
    to localized excesses in nutrients. This may be why we see what
    appear to be obvious food items under-utilized.
-   What about energetic cost of excretion?

### Notes on Bertilsson et al. (2003)

Cyanobacterium *Prochlorococcus* is the numerically dominant autotroph
in the oceans, mostly present in warm waters. *Synechococcus* is
important, too, and bigger and more widely distributed, making them
equivalent in global biomass.

Ocean POM stays close to the Redfield ratio (106:16:1), but there is
considerable spatial and seasonal variability, in part due to organismal
constraints.

Here they report on the plasticity of these organisms' C:N:P ratio. This
requires pure straints, only recently available.

The organisms differ in pigment size and motility.

When growth plateaued, P was added to verify P limitation.

Cutures reached stationary phase quicker in P-limited culture, and
growth rates were lower in P-limited media, though not significantly.

P-limited cells had greater C content (by about 33%), as well as volume.
Possibly because of need for more P in order to divide

Change in N content was variable. Only one species showed a difference,
being N-enriched when P-enriched. Mostly C:N was tightly constrained.

But P-replete species gained 4X more P. (N:P ratios were 16 and 800, 50X
difference)

Overall, all species had high C:N ratios, appear to have been P limited.
P enrichment lower C:P significantly. These organisms have low P
requirements, but can make use of more.

It's possible these organisms are missed due to filtration techniques
(less likely), or higher trophic levels are P-enriched (more likely).

P-starved level is likely the minimum, due to requirements just for
maintaining a copy of DNA. (50% of measured amount)

DNA/RNA ratio must be 1:1, while in most organisms RNA is much greater.

Low P particles may be less appealing to predators (but don't they have
to eat more then?)

Low P-content may be a strategy to reduce virus-driven mortality.

These organisms may limit growth if there were more N in the ocean.
