title: Rapid evolution as a warning sign

<p>One of the emerging themes of my course in rapid environmental change is how humans have accelerated natural processes to a pace never seen before in earth's history.&nbsp; For instance, climate change has in the past occurred at scales of tens of thousands of years or longer, but man-made climate change in happening at the pace of decades or centuries.</p>
<p>Less well-known is the effect we can have on the speed of evolution.&nbsp; Human-driven environmental pressures can force species to adapt at speeds rarely seen in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the extreme scale and intensity of fishing in the past fifty years has caused rapid evolution in fish.&nbsp; When we catch and eat all the big fish in in a population, we make it evolutionarily advantageous for fish to lay eggs when they are younger and smaller.&nbsp; During the collapse of the North Atlantic cod fishery in the late '80s and early '90s, it took just a decade for the average of maturity to drop from six years to five.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cod story is documented in a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6986/full/nature02430.html">2004 paper</a> by Olsen et. al. in <em>Nature.</em>&nbsp; While the phenomenon had been observed before, their team used a novel technique to tease the evolutionary signal out from other trends in the cod population.&nbsp;&nbsp; More interesting to me, though, is that they were able to detect the change using old data not originally collected for this purpose.&nbsp; They found that the accelerating pace of evolution was evident as far back as 1985, just as the collapse of the cod fishery was getting underway.</p>
<p>This suggests that one might be able to monitor species for evolutionary changes as a warning of extreme environmental pressures.&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors themselves warn that evolutionary changes should not be misinterpreted as signs of imminent collapse, but surely when human impacts become the driving factor behind evolution, something is amiss.&nbsp; We may be able to catch ourselves before we permanently alter a population for the worse.</p>
