<p>Over at <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/">Yale Environment 360</a>, Richard Stone has <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/massive_outbreak_of_jellyfish_could_spell_trouble_for_fisheries/2359/">an interesting article</a> about ongoing work examining recent blooms of jellyfish populations. &nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests that jellyfish populations have been on the rise, and it is possible that some marine systems are entering alternate stable states that are jellyfish- rather than fish-dominated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By removing a curb on jellyfish population growth, overfishing &ldquo;opens up ecological space for jellyfish,&rdquo; says Anthony Richardson, an ecologist at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Cleveland, Australia. And as jellyfish flourish, he says, their predation on fish eggs takes a heavier and heavier toll on battered fish stocks.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;When an ecosystem is dominated by jellyfish, fish will mostly disappear,&rdquo; says ecologist Sun Song, director of the Institute of Oceanology in Qingdao, China. &ldquo;Once that happens,&rdquo; he contends, &ldquo;there is almost no method to deal with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture is still hazy, but a working group at the fantastic <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/projects/12479">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)</a>&nbsp;is trying to gather all the data out there in order to clear it up. &nbsp;NCEAS has produced some of the most compelling work in ecology in recent years; I look forward to what they come up with.</p>
