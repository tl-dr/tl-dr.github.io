<h1>Pollen</h1>

<ul>
<li>Met with Alan to discuss the conceptual model for regime shift.  His suggestion was to look at Sugihara's method of prediction by looking at the difference paths of different systems - useful for when we have lots of data, even if it's sparse for individual sites.  Some papers to look at are : 
<ul>
<li>http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/76859 - "Distinguishing Error from Chaos in Ecological Time Series"</li>
<li>http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/54223 - "Nonlinear Forecasting for the Classification of Natural Time Series"</li>
<li>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06851 - "Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance"</li>
<li>http://www.pnas.org/content/93/6/2608.full.pdf - "Nonlinear control of heart rate variability in human infants"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Question as relevant as whether a regime shift is coming is whether a regime shift is <em>happening</em> - whether you've entered a new dynamic regime.  For high-dimensional systems, looking at summary data does a poor job of this - it's better to look at the dynamics of many components.  Could be interesting to compare % tree species to all of the species</li>
<li><p>Biggest question - Are there enough data at a site-level in the pollen?</p>
