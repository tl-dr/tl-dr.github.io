<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 225px;" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/Wildfire_in_California.jpg" alt="" /></span></span><a href="http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/">Ecosystem Marketplace</a> posted an interesting document today on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forestcarbonoffsets.nethttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/Global%20Forest%20Carbon%20Financial%20Risk%20Management%20Best%20Practices%20Final%20Dec%202010.pdf" target="_blank">Global Forest Carbon Financial Risk Management Best Practices</a>. &nbsp;Produced as part of a workshop of forest investors and lawyers, it outlines the risks in the forest carbon offset market and practices to manage these risks. &nbsp;Given the growth potential of forest carbon offset markets (not to mention other ecosystem service markets), the risk management tools for offset transactions are underdeveloped. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors document 25 different categories of risk that need to be addressed in order to develop the market. &nbsp;These include regulatory risks, currency risks, legal risks, etc. &nbsp;I&nbsp;am most interested in biophysicial risks, described here as "Unintentional Reversal" - the likelihood that an event such as fire or pest outbreak will kill off a forest and cause a loss of sequestered carbon. &nbsp;The authors suggest that these risks need to be underwritten financially. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now most programs for carbon offsets require project developers to set aside some portion of their offsets in order to create a "buffer pool" of offsets to mitigate risk of a forest failure. &nbsp;However, as one of the authors, Gabriel Thoumi,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/dynamic/article.page.php?page_id=7558&amp;section=home">points out elsewhere</a>, the registries are not the best party to manage these buffer pools because it leaves them exposed to huge risks better handled by insurance companies.</p>
<p>One topic I don't see called out here is simple performance risk. &nbsp;Catastrophic events such as fires and floods are not the only reason a forest might not take up as much carbon as planned. &nbsp; Subtler ecological and climate stresses could reduce the rates of carbon uptake below what would be projected using standard models for tree growth. &nbsp;Forest systems are more complex and less predictable than, say,&nbsp;agricultural crops, for which one has a pretty good idea of what yields will be absent frosts, droughts, and other disasters. &nbsp;So a forward contract on carbon offsets from a forest would have considerably more uncertainty than one for a bushel of corn. &nbsp;The buffer pools might be able to handle this, but I wonder how well this risk has been incorporated in their design.</p>
