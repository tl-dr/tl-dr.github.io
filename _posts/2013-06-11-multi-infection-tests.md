*Here's a little thought exercise I did that has caused me to go back
and restart my Sudden Oak Death modeling in a new framework. Feedback
welcome. I'm especially interested in relevant literature -- I haven't
found many good examples of macroparasite/multiple infection models with
age structure.*

Introduction
------------

Cobb et al. (2012) develop two models of forest stand demography in the
face of Sudden Oak Death. The first, a statistical survival model,
estimated the rates of infection and time-to-mortality as functions of
density of infected trees and tree size. The second, an $SI$ model,
projected stand composition over time using parameters from the first.

I've been realizing is that the observed data and the first model may
not square with the second model. In an $SI$ model, all infected hosts
are the same and, at least as implemented in this paper, infected trees
have a constant rate of mortality. But if you look at the bottom-right
portion of the figure below, you'll see that the rate of mortality is
strongly influenced by the number of infected hosts.

[Richard](https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/richard-cobb/) and I
discussed what might be driving this pattern, and think it might be due
to the fact that trees can be infected mutiple times. *Phytophthora
ramorum* doesn't travel throughout a tree once infecting, but instead
causes local lesions on leaves and local cankers on stems. A tree can
accumulate more of these as more spores land on it. Thus, it may not be
appropriate to represent infection as a binary state.

It's also possible that multiple infection is driving another pattern.
The upper-right panel above shows that there are strong size effects on
mortality. It's certainly possible that larger (or older) trees are more
physiologically vulnerable to the disease. However, I think part of this
may be due to the fact that larger trees have been around longer, and
thus have had more time to acquire infections.

I'm exploring these hypotheses using a model adapted from Anderson and
May (1978). This is a macroparasite model that explicitly considers the
number of parasites in each host. My model takes its basic structure and
applies it to two explicit size classes of organisms, in this case
applied to trees:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{dJ}{dt}  &= A f_A \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) + J  \left(f_J \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) - d_J - g\right) - \alpha P_J \\
  \frac{dA}{dt}  &= J g - A d_A - \alpha P_A \\
  \frac{dP_J}{dt}  &= \lambda  \frac{J}{K} (P_J + P_A)  - P_J \left(d_J + \mu + g + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{P_J}{J} \right) \right) \\
  \frac{dP_A}{dt}  &= \lambda  \frac{A}{K} (P_J + P_A)  + P_J  g - P_A \left(d_A + \mu + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{P_A}{A}  \right) \right)
\end{aligned}$$

Here $J$ and $A$ are the population of juvenile and adult trees. There's
only two size classes for simplicity, though there's no reason this
can't be extended to more. $P_J$ and $P_A$ are the total numbers of
infections amongst those trees. Here's a table of the parameters:

   Parameter                              Description
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------
   $f_J, f_J$                     Fecundity of the size class
   $d_J, d_A$                  Mortality rate of the size class
      $g$                    Rate at which juveniles become adults
    $\alpha$    Amount by which a single infection increases the mortality rate
     $\mu$        Rate at which trees recover from infections (ignored here)
      $K$                              Carrying capacity
   $\lambda$    Rate at which new infections are created by a single infection.

  : Model parameter definitions

Some notes on the model: These equations assume that infections are
completely randomly (Poisson) distributed amongst the hosts. This is
unrealistic; due to spatial structure and other processes, the
distribution is probably overdispersed. Secondly, unlike the Anderson
and May (1978) model, there's density dependence in recruitment of new
juveniles -- shading out of new recruits. Finally, transmission is
density-dependent. I assume a spore's chance of hitting a tree is
proportional to the amount of space (carrying capacity) that the tree
takes up.

Parameterizing and Running the Model
------------------------------------

I define the equations and parameters in R:

~~~~ {.r}

model <- function(t, y, parms) {
  list2env(as.list(y), environment())
  list2env(as.list(parms), environment())
  dJ <- A*f_a*(1 - (J+A)/K) + J * (f_j*(1 - (J+A)/K) - d_j - g) - alpha * PJ
  dA <- J*g - (A * d_a) - alpha * PA
  dPJ <- lambda * (PJ + PA) * J/K - PJ*(d_j + mu + g + alpha*(1 + PJ/J))
  dPA <- lambda * (PJ + PA) * A/K + PJ * g - PA*(d_a + mu + alpha*(1 + PA/A))
  return(list(c(dJ=dJ, dA=dA, dPJ=dPJ, dPA=dPA), 
              c(dJ=dJ, dA=dA, dPJ=dPJ, dPA=dPA)))
}

parms <- c( 
  f_j=0.01,
  f_a=0.01,
  g=0.1,
  d_j=0.005,
  d_a=0.005,
  alpha=0.05,
  lambda=0.3,
  K=50,
  mu=0.00
  )
~~~~

Note from the parameters that here the juvenile and adult trees are
exactly the same in their demographic variables, their contribution to
density dependence and their response to disease. That is why I call
this a "null model for age effects"; any differences between the
behavior of the size classes will be due to structural effects of the
model. Namely, that some trees carry disease as they move from juvenile
to adult size class.

The parameters are selected to be somewhat realistic for tanoak and
based on Cobb et al. (2012). Effectively, the juvenile class contains
trees with \<1 cm diameter and adults are anything larger. The carrying
capacity ($K=50$) is about equal to the stand density of many in the
plots the Cobb et al. (2012) data set.

I initiate the model with tree populations at their disease-free steady
state, and with an average of 0.1 infection per tree. Note that the
steady state has a high proportion of adults due to the
parameterization. Since density dependence in the model only affects
recruitment of new juveniles, their population is limited by the natural
death rate of adults.

~~~~ {.r}
A_ss = with(as.list(parms), K/(d_a/g + 1))
J_ss = with(as.list(parms), K - A_ss)
init <- c(J=J_ss, A=A_ss, PJ=0.1*J_ss, PA=0.1*A_ss)
~~~~

Now I run the model and calculate some relevant values that I'll explain
when I plot them:

~~~~ {.r}
require(deSolve)
require(reshape2)
out <- as.data.frame(lsoda(y=init, times=1:100, func=model, parms=parms))
df <- as.data.frame(out)
names(df)[1] <- "Time"

df <- within(df, {
  list2env(as.list(parms), environment())
  pctJ <- J/(J + A)
  pctA <- A/(J + A)
  nJ <- PJ / J
  nA <- PA / A
  J.inf <- 1 - exp(-nJ)
  A.inf <- 1 - exp(-nA)
  Inf.dens <- (J*J.inf + A*A.inf)
  J.mort <- d_j + alpha * PJ /(J * J.inf)
  A.mort <- d_a + alpha * PA / (A * A.inf)
  J.yrs <- 1/J.mort
  A.yrs <- 1/A.mort
  J.infrate <- 1 - exp(-lambda * (PJ + PA) * J * exp(-PJ/J) / K)
  A.infrate <- 1 - exp(-lambda * (PJ + PA) * A * exp(-PA/A) / K)
  J.infyrs <- 1/J.infrate
  A.infyrs <- 1/A.infrate
  rm(list=names(parms))
})

df <- df[,sort(names(df), decreasing=TRUE)]

mdf <- melt(df, id.vars=c("Time", "Inf.dens"), variable.name="Class",
            value.name="Population")
~~~~

Results and Discussion
----------------------

OK, so what does this look like? First, I plot the absolute and relative
population sizes over time:

~~~~ {.r}
require(ggplot2)
require(gridExtra)
JAlab <- scale_color_discrete(labels=c("Small Trees","Big Trees"))
p1 <- ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("J", "A")), 
             aes(x=Time, y=Population, col=Class)) + 
      geom_line(lwd=1) + theme_nr + ylab("Population") + JAlab
p2 <- ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("pctJ", "pctA")), 
             aes(x=Time, y=Population, col=Class)) + 
      geom_line(lwd=1) + theme_nr + ylab("Fraction of Population") + JAlab
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=2)
~~~~

As in the $SI$ model, the population drops, but the relative proportion
of juvenile trees goes up. This occurs even though the mortality effect
of one infection is the same on both classes. However, this could also
be due to the fact that with fewer trees, density dependence has less of
an effect on recruitment. Let's look at the prevalance of disease,
overall and per-tree:

~~~~ {.r}
p3 <- ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("PJ", "PA")),
             aes(x=Time, y=Population, col=Class)) +
      geom_line(lwd=1) + theme_nr + ylab("Number of Infections") + JAlab
p4 <- ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("nJ", "nA")),
             aes(x=Time, y=Population, col=Class)) +
      geom_line(lwd=1) + theme_nr + ylab("Infections per Individual") + JAlab
grid.arrange(p3, p4, nrow=2)
~~~~

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/multi-infection-tests-unnamed-chunk-5.png)

Infection is considerably greater in the adult trees than the juveniles
over the course of the epidemic. Since, for the most part, observqtions
of SOD don't count the number of infections, it might be easier to look
at this in terms of the number of trees infected. If we continue to
assume a Poisson distribution of infections, we can calculate the
fraction of infected trees as

$$\frac{I}{N} = 1 - e^{-\frac{P_N}{N}}$$

with $N$ being a stand-in for $J$ or $A$.

~~~~ {.r}
ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("J.inf", "A.inf")), 
       aes(x=Time, y=Population, col=Class)) + 
geom_line(lwd=1) + theme_nr + ylab("Fraction infected") + JAlab
~~~~

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/multi-infection-tests-unnamed-chunk-6.png)

Note that these curves are somewhat closer to each other. Without
observing multiple infections per tree, we might think distributions of
disease in each size class are more similar than they really are.

So how does mortality differ between the classes? I calculate the
"observed" mortality rate as the total mortality rate of *only the
diseased trees*. This is:

$$d + \frac{\alpha P_N}{N (1 - \left( e^{- \frac{P_N}{N}}\right)}$$

The inverse of this value is "Years to infection", which is the value
shown in the right-hand panels of the figure from Cobb et al. (2012)
above. Here I plot the "Years to mortality" that would be observed for
trees in the model against the number of total infected trees in the
population:

~~~~ {.r}
ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("J.yrs", "A.yrs") ), 
       aes(x=Inf.dens, y=Population, col=Class)) + 
  geom_point(cex=4) + theme_nr + xlab("Number of infected trees") + 
  ylab("Years to death of infected individuals") + JAlab
~~~~

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/multi-infection-tests-unnamed-chunk-7.png)

This plot is not quite equivalent to the lower-right panel in the figure
from Cobb et al. (2012), because that shows a snapshot in time of many
sites, while this shows the path of one site through time. Nonetheless,
it shows that years-to-death has a negative relationship with the number
of infected trees in this model, albeit a relationship that is
state-dependent. That I can recreate this effect with this model
suggests the multiple infection may drive this pattern.

Note that the mortality rate of both juveniles and adults start out the
same (Years to death $\approx$ 100), despite a higher adult population.
I think ths means the difference of infection rates is not just due to a
greater adult population, but due to the infections acquired by that
class as more infected juveniles age into it.

The expression for the rate of infection of uninfected trees is:

$$\underbrace{1 - e^{-\left(\lambda (P_J + P_A) \frac{\overbrace{Ne^{(-P_N/N)}}^{\text{previously uninfected trees}}}{K}\right)}}_{\text{fraction newly infected}}  $$

The inverse of this is "Years to Infection", which I plot below against
the number of infected trees.

~~~~ {.r}
ggplot(subset(mdf, Class %in% c("J.infyrs", "A.infyrs") ), 
       aes(x=Inf.dens, y=Population, col=Class)) + 
  geom_point(cex=4) + theme_nr + xlab("Number of infected trees") + 
  ylab("Years to infection of uninfected individuals") + JAlab + ylim(0,200)
~~~~

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/multi-infection-tests-unnamed-chunk-8.png)

This is the rough equivalent to the bottom-left panel above from the
Cobb et al. (2012). I've cut it off above 200 because years-to-infection
quickly rise as the infection rate approaches zero. Neverthless, there's
a similar pattern to year-to-mortality, albeit shallower at the
beginning and steeper at the end of the epidemic.

Next steps
----------

This looks like a good start. This model is generating patterns observed
in data on Sudden Oak Death in the wild, some explained and some
unexplained. Some next steps:

-   Examine the effect and robustness to overdisperal, when infections
    are distributed as a negative binomial. [Ross
    Meentemeyer](http://clas-pages.uncc.edu/ross-meentemeyer/) has data
    on the distribution of infections on Bay Laurel trees that may be
    useful in parameterizing this.
-   Build in the multi-species case where there are reservoir/spreader
    species (Bay Laurel) and inert competitors (Redwood).
-   Generalize to more size classes. Not strictly neccessary for
    prediction, but important for robustness.
