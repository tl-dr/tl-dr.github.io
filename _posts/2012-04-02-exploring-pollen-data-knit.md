I wrote a [few
functions](https://github.com/noamross/Pollen/commit/a7ebd4a9f46466da4c420b9437c73f8b185be56b#pollendatafuntions.R)
to grab data and from the [Global Pollen
Database](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/gpd.html):

    source("~/code/_Pollen/pollendatafuntions.R")
    ## Loading required package: stratigraph
    ## Loading required package: grid

    ## Loading required package: stats
    billys <- getpctAP("billys", plot = TRUE)
    ## Number of taxa:  105 
    ## Number of levels:  77

Clearly, there's are trends at different time scales. The trouble with
using S-Maps on this is that there are uneven sampling intervals. One
option is to use linear interpolation to approximate even intervals:

    billyslin <- linpctAP(billys, ts = FALSE)
    billys <- getpctAP("billys", plot = TRUE)
    ## Number of taxa:  105 
    ## Number of levels:  77 
    lines(billyslin[, 1], billyslin[, 2], col = "red")
    points(billyslin[, 1], billyslin[, 2], col = "red", 
        pch = 16)

This means introducing a new source of error into whatever model is
ultimately used. What interval should be used to generate this? Here I
created an equal number of points as are in the original data set.
However, the sampling density is greater at more recent dates. S-Maps
can handle missing data, but there need to be a good chunk of
consecutive points.

The other option is start thinking about how to generalize S-Maps for
data sampled at unequal intervals.
