title: Good environmental management lowers cost of borrowing

<p>Today the RiskMetrics Group ESG Blog <a href="http://blog.riskmetrics.com/esg/2010/12/2010-moskowitz-prize.html">highlights new research</a> showing that companies with better environmental performance are viewed as lower risk in bond markets and pay a lower cost of borrowing. &nbsp;The researchers, Rob Bauer and Daniel Hann, won the Moskowitz Prize for research in socially responsible investing. &nbsp;I found this the most interesting finding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...the link between environmental risk and debt costs has strengthened over time. To test this, Bauer and Hann divided their 1995-2006 data sample into two parts, and performed the same tests on data from the 1995-2001 and 2001-2006 periods. They found that the &ldquo;credit market&hellip;assigned little value to corporate environmental concerns prior to the dot-com bubble.&rdquo; The authors believe that post-bubble finance searched for new risk metrics, and found some in the form of environmental performance indicators</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems there's been <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2010/10/21/new-approaches-to-looking-at-water-related-financial-risks.html">more focus on the bond market lately</a> for those looking at corporate environmental performance. &nbsp;As Sarah King for <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2010/11/10/why-markets-should-value-green-business-growth-not-just-risk">points&nbsp;out</a>, though, this is partially because measuring the upside of environmental performance is even harder than quantifying risk.</p>
