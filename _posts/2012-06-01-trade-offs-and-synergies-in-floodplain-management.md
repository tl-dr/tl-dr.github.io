I'm pretty pleased that my IGERT team's work has garnered both Judge's
Choice and Community Choice awards in the [IGERT video and poster
competition](http://posterhall.org/igert2012/posters/306). IGERT
[(Integrative Graduate Education and Research
Traineeship)](http://www.igert.org/) is a National Science Foundation
program to foster interdisciplinary research at the graduate level. Here
at UC Davis, [our team](http://reach.ucdavis.edu/people/trainees.html)
includes ecologists and a historian, and we have been looking at how
floodplain restoration can be shaped by both bioeconomic constraints and
historical legacies. My colleague Megan Kelso explains it all in our
video:
