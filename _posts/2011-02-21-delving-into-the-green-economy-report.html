<p>UNEP published the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/GreenEconomyReport/tabid/29846/Default.aspx">Green Economy Report</a>&nbsp;(GER) today. &nbsp;I've been looking forward to reading this as it comes from the team that produced the impressive <a href="http://www.teebweb.org/">Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Study</a>&nbsp;(TEEB).</p>
<p>TEEB aimed to be the "Stern report" for biodiversity, but it was very different piece of work. &nbsp; GER, on the other hand, does something very similar to Stern - it lays out contrasting scenarios for global investment and explores their consequences. &nbsp;It describes the world's situation as one of gross misallocation of capital, and then explores a scenario where the world invests 2% of GDP into re-allocation of capital across ten major sectors. &nbsp;The take-home-message: investing in areas such as forest protection, subsidy reform in energy and fisheries, and resource efficiency will result in a long-term increase in economic growth:</p>

<p>There are great talking points in GER's <a href="http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/documents/ger/GER_synthesis_en.pdf">summary for policymakers</a>, but I think there's a lot to learn by delving into the details. &nbsp;I hope to write a few in-depth posts over the next few weeks exploring insights from the report. &nbsp;</p>
