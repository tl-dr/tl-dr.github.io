Yesterday, I was creating a `knitr` document based on a script, and was
looking for a way to include content from an R help file. The script,
which was a teaching document, had a `help()` command for when the
author wanted to refer readers to R documentation. I wanted that text in
my final document, though.

There's no standard way to do this in R, but with some help from [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7493843/how-to-write-contents-of-help-to-a-file-from-within-r)
and [Scott Chamberlain](https://gist.github.com/SChamberlain/5801605), I
figured out I needed some functions hidden in the depths of the `tools`
package. So I wrote this function:

    help_console <- function(topic, format=c("text", "html", "latex", "Rd"),
                             lines=NULL, before=NULL, after=NULL) {  
      format=match.arg(format)
      if (!is.character(topic)) topic <- deparse(substitute(topic))
      helpfile = utils:::.getHelpFile(help(topic))

      hs <- capture.output(switch(format, 
                                  text=tools:::Rd2txt(helpfile),
                                  html=tools:::Rd2HTML(helpfile),
                                  latex=tools:::Rd2latex(helpfile),
                                  Rd=tools:::prepare_Rd(helpfile)
                                  )
                          )
      if(!is.null(lines)) hs <- hs[lines]
      hs <- c(before, hs, after)
      cat(hs, sep="\n")
      invisible(hs)
    }

`help_console` prints the help file to the console or lets you assign
the help file text to a character. Below, I use it to dynamically print
the start of the help file for the `optim()` function as quoted HTML
(note that the `knitr` chunk has the option `results='asis')`:

~~~~ {.r}
help_console(optim, "html", lines = 1:25, before = "<blockquote>", after = "</blockquote>")

<h2>
General-purpose Optimization
</h2>

<h3>
Description
</h3>

<p>
General-purpose optimization based on Nelderâ€“Mead, quasi-Newton and
conjugate-gradient algorithms. It includes an option for box-constrained
optimization and simulated annealing.
</p>


<h3>
Usage
</h3>

<pre>
optim(par, fn, gr = NULL, ..., method = c("Nelder-Mead", "BFGS", "CG",
"L-BFGS-B", "SANN", "Brent"), lower = -Inf, upper = Inf, control =
list(), hessian = FALSE)

The function is part of my [`noamtools` package on
GitHub](https://github.com/noamross/noamtools/blob/master/R/help_console.R),
where I keep various convenience functions. Enjoy, and fork if you have
improvements!
