For the past week I've been at the [Mathematical Biosciences
Institute](http://mbi.osu.edu/) at Ohio State, attending the [Workshop
on Sustainable Management of Living Natural
Resources](http://mbi.osu.edu/2013/ws3description.html). It's been an
absolutely top-notch meeting. I need to get myself to more of these
small workshops.

I brought a poster describing some of my work in progress on managing
Sudden Oak Death. Here it is, and it's archived over at
[Figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.833911).
