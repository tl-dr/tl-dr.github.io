title: REDD+ and Financial Resilience for Conservation

<p>This month's&nbsp;<em>Conservation Letters </em>has a <a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00155.x">Policy Perspective</a>&nbsp;on the risks of relying REDD+ funding for conservation projects. &nbsp;REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, with the "+" standing for biodiversity and social benefits), is a mechanism for&nbsp;transferring&nbsp;funds to developing countries for forest preservation and restoration. &nbsp;REDD+ financing is eventually supposed to flow primarily from the private sector, and it is one of the few parts of an international climate agreement that has been uncontentious in negotiations.</p>
<p>REDD+ presents a potentially huge new pool of funds for biodiversity conservation, but the authors caution that it comes with a set of risks:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political risk: </strong>While some REDD+ financing is already beginning to flow, the bulk of the funds are reliant on a future compliance regime regime that will incentivize companies to finance REDD+ in lieu of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. &nbsp;Given the slow progress of efforts to put such laws in place, in the near REDD+ funds are more akin to international aid, which the authors note is "notoriously volatile."</li>
<li><strong>Competition risk: &nbsp;</strong>REDD+ is primarily a tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity conservation is a co-benefit. &nbsp;The authors describe this a problem of "mismatched time scales," but its really a matter of substitutability and competition. &nbsp;As low-carbon technologies become cheaper, they may become cheaper&nbsp;substitutes&nbsp;for forest carbon sequestration, lowering demand for REDD+. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The authors point to a number of strategies to reduce these risks, including diversification of funding sources, including both traditional donor financing and other payments for ecosystem services, and the development of insurance mechanisms. &nbsp;They also promote the use of conservation trust funds to pool REDD+ capital and distribute the interest - a conservative but stabilizing strategy.</p>
<p>There are a number of other risks associated with tying conservation funding with a nascent commodity market, and the authors urge conservationists to look to the private sector, which has been hesitant to invest in REDD+, and exercise similar cautions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it would be an interesting exercise for conservation organizations to look at this <a href="http://www.forestcarbonoffsets.nethttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/Global%20Forest%20Carbon%20Financial%20Risk%20Management%20Best%20Practices%20Final%20Dec%202010.pdf">list of investment risks&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;produced by forest investors in order to understand what drives this hesitancy. &nbsp;If a conservation project can address these comprehensively, it's a lot more likely to be able to secure consistent funding.</p>
