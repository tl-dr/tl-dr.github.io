<p>Two papers crossed my desk yesterday highlighting the role insurance can play in mitigating environmental risk.&nbsp; The first, by Yin et. al. in <em>Risk Analysis</em>, discusses <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20807380">three appoaches to mitigating the risk of leaking underground storage tanks</a> (a problem with the fantastic acronym LUST).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large fines for spills, as it turns out, are not a particularly efficient enforcement tool, as most LUSTs are owned by small businesses like gas stations that would likely go bankrupt before paying all the fines and cleanup costs.&nbsp; Many large firms outsource or spin off their tank operations to smaller companies so that they can declare bankruptcy in such an event.</p>
<p>Another option is to have a set of safety regulations that are strictly enforced.&nbsp; However, the EPA and state regulators have lacked the resources to send inspectors into the field to make sure USTs are up to code.</p>
<p>Mandating insurance for tank owners, on the other hand, lowers the burden on regulators and also spreads the cost to operators out into a string of premium payments.&nbsp; Some states have created public quasi-insurance funds by forcing industry to pay for cleanups through a gasoline tax.&nbsp; However, it turns out that private insurers are better and forcing their customers to manage their tanks for safety.&nbsp; The authors are able to show that in states that have robust private insurance markets for LUSTs, there are about 35% fewer spills.</p>
<p>In <em>Ecological Econmics</em>, D.S. Holland writes about <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VDY-5131R3M-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F23%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=18b281b6067c27555e9372c8b107185e&amp;searchtype=a">possible insurance options for fishery markets</a>.&nbsp; Some fisheries have total bycatch quotas, meaning that the fishery is shut down when a total amount of bycatch is caught.&nbsp; For example, if, collectively, all the Pacific flounder fisherman catch 20 loggerhead turtles, then regulators declare no more Paciifc flounder fishing for the year.</p>
<p>This can lead a "race to fish", where fisherman try to catch all they can before the fishery is shut down.&nbsp; Holland explores the possibility of bycatch insurance where fisherman are compensated for a loss of revenue if the fishery is shut down earlier than expected.&nbsp; This is only tangentially related to the LUST insurance above, but it again creates an interesting situation where the insurance company is incentivized to reduce its clients' environmental damages.&nbsp; In this case, would insurers force fisherman to find ways to reduce bycatch?</p>
<p>I'm interested to see how insurance models scale up to addressing large scale, systemic ecological risks.&nbsp; There's an intruiging example of the potential of private insurance in the <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002577.html">underwriting of reforestation in the Panama Canal</a>.&nbsp; Where else is it applicable?</p>
