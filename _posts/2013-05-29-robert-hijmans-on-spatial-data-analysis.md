Last week at the [Davis R Users'
Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html) Robert Hijmans
gave a talk about spatial data analysis in R. Robert is [a professor of
biogeography](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NWdPabcAAAAJ&hl=en)
at UC Davis and the author of the
[`raster`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) (analysis of
gridded data), [`dismo`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/)
(species distribution modeling), and
[`geosphere`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/)
(spherical trigonometry), packages.

Robert's presentation spanned topics including basic geographical data
and geostatistics concepts, his `raster` package and its usage, and some
great examples of visualization and other resources. Here are his
slides:

Robert has also written an [introduction to spatial modeling for R
beginners](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/Introduction%20to%20spatial%20data%20handling%20in%20R.pdf)
which reviews very basic data handling and the `sp` and `raster`
packages. Finally, his package vignettes are great resources for specific
topics:

-   [Introduction to the raster
    package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf)
-   [Writing functions for large raster
    files](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/functions.pdf)
-   [Species Distribution modeling with
    R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/sdm.pdf)
-   [Boosted Regression Trees for ecological
    modeling](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/brt.pdf)
