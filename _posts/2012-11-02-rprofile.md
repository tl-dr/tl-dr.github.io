[Ryan Peek](http://watershed.ucdavis.edu/people/ryan-peek) showed us how
to use an `.Rprofile` file to customize your R setup. Here are his
instructions and script:

For Windows
-----------

-   To change profile for R, go here:

    `C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1\etc` (or whatever version you are
    using)

-   Edit the "Rprofile.site" file
-   Restart R

For Macs
--------

-   Create your Rprofile file. -use TextEdit or another editor to create
    a file called Rprofile.txt

-   In a terminal window, type:

    `>> cp Rprofile.txt .Rprofile`

    (which copies the visible Rprofile.txt to the invisible .Rprofile)

    -   You can check this by doing `>ls -la` again to see it in the
        directory listing.

-   Restart R

Note that you can save `.Rprofile` in your home directory, or, if you
are using R Studio, in a *project* directory. In the latter case, the
profile will only be loaded when you load that project.

### Things to put in the `.Rprofile` file:

***Set a local CRAN Mirror:***

~~~~ {.r}
local({r <- getOption("repos")
       r["CRAN"] <- "http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/"
       options(repos=r)})
~~~~

***Set machine-specific options:*** If you use Dropbox or something
similar to sync R files across computers, you can use `Sys.info()` to
set options specifically for your machine. This code sets the root path
differently for different machines:

~~~~ {.r}
if(Sys.info()[4]=="Work-PC") {
  root<-"C://Users//Ryan//Desktop//Dropbox//R//"
} else if(Sys.info()[4]=="Mac.local") {
  root<-"/Users/Ryan/Dropbox/R/"
} else {
  root<-"C://Users//rapeek//Dropbox//R//"
}
~~~~

***Set a welcome message and load a file of other useful functions:***
Anything in the `.First` function is run on startup

~~~~ {.r}
.First <- function(){
    cat("\nWelcome to R!\n",sep="")
    cat("---------------\n\n",sep="")
    
    if(file.exists("~/RbasicFunctions_example.r")){
        source("~/RbasicFunctions_example.r")
        cat("RbasicFunctions_example.r was loaded, providing the following functions:\n\n",sep="")
        cat("use  'print.functions()'  to view\n",sep="")
    }
}
~~~~

### Helper functions

[Here's Ryan's file](https://gist.github.com/4003343), called above as `RbasicFunctions_example.r`, which
has his helper functions. Running `print.functions()` will display a
list of these with short explanations:

A lot of other useful options for R profile files are found in [this
