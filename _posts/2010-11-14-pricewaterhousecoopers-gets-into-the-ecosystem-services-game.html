title: PricewaterhouseCoopers gets into the ecosystem services game

<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/Screenshot 15.PNG" alt="" /></span></span>I've noticed a rise lately in the frequency of times I see the name <a href="http://www.pwc.com/">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> pop up in research about ecosystem services and economics. &nbsp; Most recently they have produced <a href="http://pwc.co.uk/eng/publications/habitat_banking_feasible_for_latin_america_and_the_caribbean.html">a series of reports</a>&nbsp;with the United Nations Development Program on habitat banking in Latin America and the Carribean. &nbsp;Habitat banking is an ecosystem service market in which habitat "developers" protect or restore ecosystems to generate credits that can be bought by other developers as part of a requirement to mitigate damage caused by construction projects. &nbsp;PwC's reports evaluate the benefits of such systems and barriers to to implementation in eight countries. &nbsp; They should be required reading for anyone getting involved in such schemes in Latin America.</p>
<p>That's not all PwC has been up to, though. &nbsp;It appears that PwC have been major contributors to the <a href="http://www.teebweb.org/ForBusiness/TEEBforBusinessDraftChapters/tabid/29434/Default.aspx">business sector portion </a>of <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2010/10/23/thinking-about-teeb.html">The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study</a>, and did most of the heavy lifting on Ceres' recent <a href="http://www.ceres.org/Page.aspx?pid=1291">report</a>&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.noamross.net/blog/2010/10/21/new-approaches-to-looking-at-water-related-financial-risks.html">water-related risks in the bond market</a>.</p>
<p>PwC isn't entirely new to environmental work. &nbsp;They also just published their <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2010/11/10/pwc-finds-boom-csr-reporting-despite-recession">4th annual survey&nbsp;on the state of sustainability reporting</a>, and I when I worked in consulting one would occasionally encounter their stamp as an auditor of corporate greenhouse gas accounting. &nbsp;It &nbsp;seems that now they're investing in becoming a major knowledge provider in the ecosystem services market. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense. &nbsp;PwC's bread and butter is accounting, and someone will have to audit the transactions of emerging habitat banking markets. &nbsp; McKinsey &amp; Co., another big consultancy, followed a similar strategy on climate change. &nbsp; They published a series of influential reports on the cost of carbon mitigation technologies in the mid-2000s, and established a foothold in international carbon trading by partnering with the Clinton Global Initiative's program in climate and forestry. &nbsp;(Full disclosure: I played a very minor role providing outside feedback on a McKinsey/CGI's forestry report). &nbsp;Now McKinsey gets paid to craft whole <a href="http://www.redd-monitor.org/2010/10/07/mckinseys-redd-plans-in-papua-new-guinea-nice-work-if-you-can-get-it/">government strategies</a>&nbsp;for international climate negotiations.</p>
<p>I think this is a good sign. &nbsp;If PwC is investing in this field, it's a sign that ecosystem services and biodiversity are on the minds of their clients.</p>
