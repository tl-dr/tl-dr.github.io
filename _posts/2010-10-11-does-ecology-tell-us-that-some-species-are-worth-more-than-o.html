title: Does ecology tell us that some species are worth more than others?

<p>I just read a great <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/0006-3568%282005%29055%5B0168:SISCPM%5D2.0.CO%3B2">paper</a> by Michael Soul&eacute; et. al. discussing the management implications some ideas in ecology that have outpaced environmental policy.</p>
<p>The authors, a mix of ecologists and conservationists,&nbsp; argue that some species, which they call "strongly interacting species," deserve higher priority in conservation because of their unique roles in ecosystems.&nbsp; These species have gone by many names in the ecological literature, including "keystone species," and "ecosystem engineers."&nbsp; Essentially, these species have a strong effect on the species around them and the functioning of their ecosystems.&nbsp; For instance, sea otters eat sea urchins, preventing the urchins from razing kelp forests. &nbsp; Prairie dogs turn over and improve soil, increase plant productivity, creates new habitat for other species.</p>
<p>One problem the authors point out is that our existing policy tools are not designed to handle this level of complexity.&nbsp; The Endangered Species Act only requires that species be protected until their populations are large enough to prevent extinction.&nbsp; But much larger populations are neccessary for these species to perform their ecological function effectively.</p>
<p>I think this raises some really interesting economic questions.&nbsp; For instance, if a species is shown to have a greater ecological function, is it worth more from a social or economic point of view?&nbsp; It seems to me that such species would have a greater value in delivering ecosystem services, as well as maintaining the "intrinsic" or "existence" value of an ecosystem to society.</p>
<p>Also, how do we measure and define "strongly interacting" species?&nbsp; The authors put forward some qualitative questions one could ask.&nbsp; (e.g., "Does the absence or decrease in abundance of the species change an important ecological process in the system?")&nbsp; However, I think it's a pretty useful exercise to try to figure out what a standardized, quantitative measure would be.&nbsp;&nbsp; One could theoretically measure the relative impact of one individual of a species on, say, a number that represents food web complexity, or system stability.&nbsp; This might get us closer to finding effective ways to quantify "regulating" ecosystem services, which are the most difficult to value.</p>
<p>Is there any work out there that's attempted to compare the relative importance of "strongly interacting" species across different ecosystems?&nbsp; I'd love to hear others' thoughts on this topic.</p>
