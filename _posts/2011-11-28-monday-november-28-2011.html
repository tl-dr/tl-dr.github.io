<h1>Pollen Data for Williams (2010)</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>List of sources of data, but not data, is in a table in the <a href="ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/reposit/2010/2010027.pdf">supplementary material</a></li>
<li>Most records are from <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/napd.html">North American Pollen Database (NAPD)</a></li>
<li>
<p>Just browsing through the datasets from this, it looks like a challenge may be that there isn't much data preceding most of the abrupt shifts - there may not be anything resembling a baseline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
